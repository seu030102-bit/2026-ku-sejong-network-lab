"""Week 3 · Task 3 — Beat the baseline cache.

Textbook §2.4.2 (caching) and §2.4.3 (TTL).

`BaselineCache` below works. It is also bad, in more than one way, and one of
its problems is worse than being slow. Find them, write `YourCache`, and prove
the improvement with the harness:

    python3 bench.py                 # baseline only
    python3 bench.py --yours         # baseline vs. yours, side by side

Rules
-----
* Do not change `bench.py`. If you need to change it to win, you are not
  winning. Say so in observation.md instead.
* `YourCache` must expose the same two methods as `BaselineCache`.
* Speed is not the only score. The harness also counts **stale answers** -
  times you served a record whose TTL had already run out. A cache that keeps
  everything forever is very fast and completely wrong.

Targets
-------
The baseline scores **325 upstream queries, 67.5% hit rate, 266 stale answers**.

  pass  : zero stale answers
  good  : zero stale, and no more upstream queries than the baseline
  strong: the above, plus you can say in observation.md **how few upstream
          queries a correct cache could possibly make on this workload, and
          why you cannot go below that number**

That last one is the real question. Read it before you start optimising -
it will tell you where to stop.

class YourCache:
    """A cache that keeps each record for the TTL the upstream actually gave.

    The baseline's fixed 60 s lifetime is both of its bugs: names whose TTL is
    shorter than 60 s are handed out after they have expired, and names whose
    TTL is longer are thrown away early. Storing `expires_at = now + ttl` and
    refusing to answer past that instant fixes both. A dict replaces the linear
    scan; the harness scores upstream queries, not CPU, so the TTL is what
    moves the numbers.

    This is also the floor. Serving past the TTL is a stale answer, and
    refreshing before the TTL only adds upstream queries. No correct cache can
    go below the miss count this policy produces on the harness workload.
