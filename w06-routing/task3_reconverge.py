"""Week 6 · Task 3 — Reconverge without recomputing the world.

Textbook §5.2.1, §5.3.

A link flaps. Every router in the area has to decide what changed. `FullRecompute`
does the honest thing: throw the table away and run Dijkstra again, from scratch,
for every event. It is correct and it is what the first implementations did.

It is also why a single flapping link in a large area used to melt the CPU of
every router that could see it.

Beat it:

    python3 bench.py
    python3 bench.py --yours

Correctness first. `bench.py` compares your table against a full recompute after
**every single event**. A router that is fast and wrong black-holes traffic.
